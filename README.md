## Mobile API tests

Since mobile is all about a ReST protocol for sync, we can test it at the ReST level.

We can also drive the clients from a ReST interface, having them apply load to server components.

## Install the servers under test

You should be able to get away with, at a bare minimum, LiteServ and Sync Gateway. If you have both of those, you should be able to run all the topologies. But if you add more hosts or want to test Sync Gateway storage with CBGB or Couchbase Server you'll need to configure those.

### Couchbase Lite

To install LiteServ, download the latest stable build from the link [in the Couchbase Lite README](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios) and find LiteServ in the MacOS directory. Edit `config/local.js` to link to it.

### Sync Gateway

Follow the instructions [on the Sync Gateway readme, about how to install](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sync_gateway/wiki/Installing-and-Upgrading). Remember the path you downloaded it to so you can edit `config/local.js` to point to it.

### Node.js

You'll need a newish Node.js install (>0.8) with npm. We recommend `brew install nodejs`

# How to run these tests

First edit `config/local.js` to point to your build of LiteServ (found via "Products" in Xcode). Also to your local bin/sync_gateway

Get the dependencies with `npm install`. (It reads `package.json` to know what to get.)

Make a `tmp` directory inside your `cblite-tests` checkout, by running `mkdir tmp`

Run the tests with `npm test`. NPM test will pick up any file in the 'tests' directory.

To run a particular test, try `node tests/liteserv-phalanx.js`

## How to run performance tests:

The simplest way to run a perf test is to update config/perf.js to match your configuration and start the test using run.js:
`node perf/run.js`

You can also start tests over http by starting a listener and sending the request over http:
`node lib/listener.js`
`http POST http://127.0.0.1:8189/run/perf/readwrite db=test-perf workload=readwrite numClients=2 writeRatio=10 readRatio=0 requestsPerSec=1 runtime=60 providers:='["http://127.0.0.99:8189"]' enablepull:=false`

Note: values in config/perf.js will be used by default for any specified arguments, otherwise http query params will override those variables

Collected stats will be stored into perfdb specefied in `config/perf.js`.  This can be any endpoint that implements the couchdb api. 

## Scaling Performance tests:
Clients can be added to a test by setting up additional providers.  A provider is any host where `lib/listener.js` has been started.  This provider should have it's `config/local.js` updated to specify what kind of clients it provides.  You should also set the listener ip to the hosts public IP so that the provider can be reached remotely.  

Currently the quickest way to scale up clients is to make lots of pouchdb providers. For example:

1) pull repo to a new vm and edit `config/local.js`
 * set => provides  : "pouchdb"
 * set => LocalListenerIP : "172.x.x.x"    (or export LOCAL_IP="172.x.x.x")
 * node lib/listener.js

2) set up as many providers you want.  estimate a max of 200 clients can be started per pouchdb provider on average hardware.

3) navigate to the repo where the test will be running from and edit it's `config/perf.js`:
 * set => providers : ["172.x.x.1", "172.x.x.2", ...]
 
4) `node perf/run.js`

The numClients will be distributed across providers.  You can have a mix of ios/android/pouch providers all in the same array.  
But this assumes you can start an equal amount of clients for each provider.  In most cases it's best to start 2 different perf tests.
1 that runs against pouchdb providers with many clients/provider, and another that runs against ios with fewer clients.

Also note statcollection will only work against perf tests where an ios provider can be detected so you should only specify perfdb
in the enviornment where ios providers are specified.

## Perf stat analysis
During the test run, stats can be pushed to perfdb set in `config/perf.js`.  This can be any couchdb compliant endpoint.  By default there is an internal pouchdb instance started for storing stats, but this instance is stopped at the end of the run.  For persisted stat data, it's recommend you use a public couchdb our couchcloud.

When the test is being run you will see the statcollector printing latency stats, as this is what's currently collected.  One possible way to do post-run analysis is to create a couchdb view on the data in perfdb using the testid that is printed out in the console when tests starts:

* sample start log
`{ err: null,
  ok:
   { testid: 'perf_1566814',
     numClients: 100,
`

* view over test data for testid perf_1566814
`function(doc) {
   if(doc._id.indexOf("perf_1566814") != -1){
  	emit(doc.elapsed_time, [ doc['directsg-change'].avg, doc.change.avg, (doc.docs_written - doc.docs_relayed)]);
   }
}`

this will give key's that match elapsed_time of test and values that correspond to delay stats


## Troubleshooting

`killall LiteServ` is your friend.
